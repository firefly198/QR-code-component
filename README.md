## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- CSS

### What I learned

I learned using Flexbox

```css
.proud-of-this-css {
      display: flex;
      flex-direction: column;
      justify-content: flex-start;
      align-items: center;
      gap: 22px;
}
```

### Continued development

I am really confused how to select font sizes, bacause there were no buttons and then AI gave me font links. I hope 
someone will teach me that.
